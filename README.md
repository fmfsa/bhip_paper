# BHIP
Bayesian Hierarchical Invariant Causal Predictors

**src** folder contains the code for the BHIP algorithm. The code is written in Python. 

**bus_dwelling_time.ipynb** is a notebook that contains the bus dwelling problem as well solutions using BHIP with non-centered parametrization, horseshoe or spike and slab priors as well as ICP.

**experiments.py** and **computational_study.py** have the scripting code to run the experiments relative to the quantitative study and the computational study, respectively. 

Finally **example_environment_split_school.ipynb** is a notebook that contains the example of the school problem as well as solutions using BHIP with non-centered parametrization. Horseshoe, spike and slab priors as well as ICP solutions are in **school_spike_and_slab.ipynb**.
